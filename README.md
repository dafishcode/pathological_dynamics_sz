# pathological_dynamics_sz
Repo for analysing and modelling pathological dynamics in seizures - using dimensionality, stability and manifold analysis. 

'dimensionality' - analysing the dimensionality of dynamics using PCA

'net_dyn' - network simulations looking at the effect of network topology on dynamic range

'net_state' - manifold learning to identify the topology of spontaneous vs focal vs generalised seizure dynamics - plans to use persistent homology - work in progress!

'stability' - evaluating the stability of dynamics and smoothness of manifold in spontaneous vs focal vs generalised seizure dynamics

'state_space_sim' - simulate the link between eigenspectrum dimensionality and manifold smoothness
